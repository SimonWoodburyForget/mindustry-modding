* Overview
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: the things you may not know.
  :END:

  Mindustry mods are simply directories of assests. You reuse existing types and can use different values to initialize them, and you can even overwrite initialization of vanilla content.

  You can add custom sprites and sounds; sharing your mod is as simple as giving someone your project directory; mods are also cross platfrom to any platform that supports them.

  It is also now possible to put schematics into mods

** Directory Structure
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: how things should look.
   :END:

   Your project directory should look something like this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
   project
   ├── schematics
   ├── bundles
   ├── content
   │   ├── blocks
   │   └── items
   ├── mod.json
   ├── sounds
   └── sprites
   #+END_SRC

   Every platform has a different user application data directory, and this is where your mods should be placed:
   * Linux: =~/.local/share/Mindustry/mods/=
   * Steam: =steam/steamapps/common/Mindustry/mods/=
   * Windows: =%appdata%/Mindustry/mods/=

   *Note;* your filenames should be lowercased and hyphen separated:
   * correct: ~my-custom-block.json~
   * incorrect: ~My Custom Block.json~

** ~mod.json~
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: the project configuration file.
   :END:

   At the root of your project directory, you must have a ~mod.json~ which defines the basic metadata for your project.

   #+BEGIN_SRC json
   {
       "name": "Mod Name",
       "author": "Yourself",
       "description": "This is a useless description.",
       "version": "1.0",
       "dependencies": [ ]
   }
   #+END_SRC

   Notes:
   * ~name~ will be used to reference to your mod, so name it carefully, and avoid giving it the same name as another mod.
   * ~description~ of the mod will be rendered in the ingame mod manager, so keep it short and to the point.
   * ~dependencies~ is optional; if you want to know more about that, go to the [[Dependencies][dependencies]] section.

** Content
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: content configuration directory
   :END:

   At the root of your project directory you can have a ~content/~ directory, this is where all the JSON data goes for your content, and in this directory you have subdirectories for the various content types, these are the current common ones:

   * ~content/items/~ for [[Item][items]], like ~copper~ and ~surge-alloy~;
   * ~content/blocks/~ for [[Block][blocks]], like turrets and floors;
   * ~content/mechs/~ for [[Mech][mechs]], like ~tau~ and ~glaive~;
   * ~content/liquids/~ for [[Liquid][liquids]], like ~water~ and ~slag~;
   * ~content/units/~ for flying or ground [[UnitType][units]], like ~reaper~ and ~dagger~;
   * ~content/zones/~ for [[Zone][zones]], configuration of campaign maps.

   This is important, because it's how Mindustry will know which types to lookup. -- How you name your files is also important as the stem ~name~ of your path ~content/blocks/<name>.json~ is going to be used to reference it.

   The content of these files should look as follows:

   #+BEGIN_SRC json
   {
       "type": "TypeOfThing",
       "name": "Name Of Thing",
       "description": "Description of thing."
   }
   #+END_SRC

   | field       | type   | notes                             |
   |-------------+--------+-----------------------------------|
   | type        | String | Content type of this object.      |
   | name        | String | Displayed name of content.        |
   | description | String | Displayed description of content. |

   Other fields included would be the fields of the ~type~ in question.

** Types
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: what you need to know about type
   :END:

   Types have numerous fields, but the important one is ~type~; this is a special field used by the content parser, that changes which type your object is. /A ~Router~ type can't be a ~Turret~ type/, as they're just completely different.

   Types /extend/ each other, so if ~MissileBulletType~ extends ~BasicBulletType~, you'll have access to all the fields of ~BasicBulletType~ inside of ~MissileBulletType~ like ~damage~, ~lifetime~ and ~speed~. Fields are case sensitive: ~hitSize =/= hitsize~.

   What you can expect a field to do is up to the specific type, some types do absolutely nothing with their fields, and work mostly as a base types will extend from. One such type is ~Block~.

   ~type~ can be refer to the actual type field of the object. A type may also refer to other things like ~float~ is a type so it means you can type ~0.3~ in a field.

   Here you can see, the type of the top level object is ~Revenant~, but the type of the ~bullet~ is ~BulletType~ so you can use ~MissileBulletType~, because ~MissileBulletType~ extends ~BulletType~.

   #+BEGIN_SRC json
   {
       "type": "Revenant",
       "weapon": {
           "bullet": {
               "type": "MissileBulletType",
               "damage": 9000
           }
       }
   }
   #+END_SRC

** Tech Tree
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: putting blocks into the tech tree
   :END:

   Much like ~type~ there exist another magical field known as ~research~ which can go at the root of any block object to put it in the techtree.

   #+BEGIN_SRC json
   {
       "research": "duo"
   }
   #+END_SRC

   This would put your block after ~duo~ in the techtree, and to put it after your own mods block you would write your ~<block-name>~, a mod name prefix is only required if you're using the content from another mod.

   Research cost will be ~30 + requirements * 6~, where ~requirements~ is the build cost of your block. /(in otherwords you can't set ~requirements~ and ~research cost~ individually)/

** Sprites
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: image files and how to name them
   :END:

   All you need to make sprites, is an image editor that supports transparency /(aka: not paint)./ Block sprites should be ~32 * size~, so a ~2x2~ block would require a ~64x64~ image. Images must be ~.png~ files with 32 bit depth.

   Sprites can simply be dropped in the ~sprites/~ subdirectory. The content parser will look through it recursively, so you can organize them how ever you feel.

   Content is going to look for sprites relative to it's own name. ~content/blocks/my-hail.json~ has the name ~my-hail~ and similarly ~sprites/my-hail.png~ has the name ~my-hail~, so it'll be used by this content.

   Content may look for multiple sprites. ~my-hail~ could be a turret, and it could look for the suffix ~<name>-heat~ and what this means is it'll look for ~my-hail-heat~.

   You can find all the vanilla sprites here:
   * https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/tree/master/core/assets-raw/sprites

   Another thing to know about sprites is that they're passed through /anti-aliasing filters/ and what that means is that they may look a little different in game. -- The turrets specifically have a special black border filter added to them, so you must account for that while making your sprites, and leave a border of transparent space around them, for example: [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anuken/Mindustry/master/core/assets-raw/sprites/blocks/turrets/ripple.png][Ripple]]

** Sound
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: sound files and where to put them
   :END:

  Custom sounds can be added through the modding system by dropping them in the ~sounds/~ subdirectory. It doesn't matter where you put them. Two formats are needed:

  * ~.ogg~ required for Desktop/Android
  * ~.mp3~ required for iOS

  Just like any other assets, you reference them by the stem of your filenames, so ~pewpew.ogg~ and ~pewpew.mp3~ can be referenced with ~pewpew~ from a field of type ~Sound~.

  Here's a list of built-in sounds:
  * ~artillery~
  * ~back~
  * ~bang~
  * ~beam~
  * ~bigshot~
  * ~boom~
  * ~break~
  * ~build~
  * ~buttonClick~
  * ~click~
  * ~conveyor~
  * ~corexplode~
  * ~door~
  * ~drill~
  * ~empty~
  * ~explosionbig~
  * ~explosion~
  * ~fire~
  * ~flame2~
  * ~flame~
  * ~laserbig~
  * ~laser~
  * ~machine~
  * ~message~
  * ~missile~
  * ~pew~
  * ~place~
  * ~press~
  * ~release~
  * ~respawning~
  * ~respawn~
  * ~shootBig~
  * ~shoot~
  * ~shootSnap~
  * ~shotgun~
  * ~spark~
  * ~splash~
  * ~spray~
  * ~thruster~
  * ~unlock~
  * ~wave~
  * ~windowHide~

** Dependencies
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: mods extending mods
   :END:

   You can add dependencies to your mod by simple adding other mods name in your ~mod.json~:

   #+BEGIN_SRC json
   {
       "dependencies": [
           "other-mod-name",
           "not-a-mod"
       ]
   }
   #+END_SRC

   The name of dependencies are lower-cased and spaces are replaced with ~-~ hyphens, for example ~Other MOD NamE~ becomes ~other-mod-name~.

   To reference the other mods assets, you must prefix the asset with the other mods name:

   * ~other-mod-name-not-copper~ would reference ~not-copper~ in ~other-mod-name~
   * ~other-mod-name-angry-dagger~ would reference ~angry-dagger~ in ~other-mod-name~
   * ~not-a-mod-angry-dagger~ would reference ~angry-dagger~ in ~not-a-mod~

** Bundles
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: translations and renaming
   :END:

   An optional addition to your mod is called bundles. The main use of bundles are give translations of your content, but there's no reason you couldn't use them in English. These are plaintext files which go in the ~bundles/~ subdirectory, and they should be named something like ~bundle_ru.properties~ (for Russian).

   The contents of this file is very simple:

   #+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
   block.example-mod-silver-wall.name = Серебряная Стена
   block.example-mod-silver-wall.description = Стена из серебра.
   #+END_SRC

   If you've read the first few sections of this guide, you'll spot it right away:
   * ~<content type>.<mod name>-<content name>.name~
   * ~<content type>.<mod name>-<content name>.description~

   Notes:
   * mod/content names are lowercased and hyphen separated.

   List of content type:
   * ~item~
   * ~block~
   * ~mech~
   * ~bullet~
   * ~liquid~
   * ~status~
   * ~unit~
   * ~weather~
   * ~effect~
   * ~zone~
   * ~loadout~
   * ~typeid~

   List of filenames relative to languages:

   * English ~bundle.properties~
   * Czech ~bundle_cs.properties~
   * German ~bundle_de.properties~
   * Spanish ~bundle_es.properties~
   * Estonian ~bundle_et.properties~
   * Basque ~bundle_eu.properties~
   * French BE ~bundle_fr_BE.properties~
   * French ~bundle_fr.properties~

   * Turkish ? ~bundle_tr.properties~
   * Ukrainian ~bundle_uk_UA.properties~
   * Chinese CN ~bundle_zh_CN.properties~
   * Chinese TW ~bundle_zh_TW.properties~

** Hjson
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: content parser syntax
   :END:

   *new:* /currently partially implimented on [[bleeding-edge][bleeding-edge]], where only ~content/~ uses Hjson./

   As of now, Mindustry doesn't actually use Json, /(but any valid JSON should work)/ it uses a variant of Json called [[https://hjson.org/][Hjson]].

   #+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
   {
       # single line comment

       // single line comment

       /* multiline
          comment */

       key1: single line string

       key2: '''
             multiline
             string
             '''

       key3: [ value 1
               value 2
               value 3 ]
   }
   #+END_SRC

** Schematic

   Fields that require the type ~Schematic~ can either take a built-in loadout /(see the [[Zone]] section)/ a base64 string, or the stem name of a ~.msch~ file in the ~schematics/~ subdirectory.

   /As of now, the only purpose of schematics is to give a zone a loadout./

** FAQ
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: simple questions and awnsers
    :END:

    * ~time~ in game is calculated through ~ticks~;
    * ~ticks~ /sometimes called ~frames~,/ are assumed to be 60/1 second;
    * ~range~ or most forms of distance is 1/10 of a tile;
    * to calculate range out of ~lifetime~ and ~speed~ you can do ~lifetime * speed = range~;
    * <<Abstract>> what is ~abstract~? all you need to know about abstract types, is this is a Java specific term, which means you cannot instantiate/initialize this specific type by itself. If you do so you'll probably get an /"initialization exception"/ of some kind;
    * what is a ~NullPointerException~? This is an error message that indicates a field is null and shouldn't be null, meaning one of the required fields may be missing;
    * <<bleeding-edge>> what is ~bleeding-edge~? This is the developer version of Mindustry, specifically it's refering to the Github master branch. Changes on bleeding-edge usually make it into Mindustry in the next release.

* World
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: the universe and everything in it.
  :END:

** NEW Block
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: base type of types that go on tiles
   :end:

   Extends [[BlockStorage][BlockStorage]]

   Block is the base type of all blocks in the game. All blocks have at least one sprite, which is picked relative to the blocks name.

** Consumers
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: base type to consume liquid, items and power
   :END:

   This type is commonly used in block type with it's field ~consumes~, it's a type that allows your block to consume something, and how this field works is up to the specific type extension you're using.

   | field         | type                  | notes      |
   |---------------+-----------------------+------------|
   |               |                       | <10>       |
   | item          | String                | shorthand for ~items~ |
   | items         | [[ConsumeItems][ConsumeItems]]          | consume a number of different items |
   | liquid        | [[ConsumeLiquid][ConsumeLiquid]]         | consume a single liquid |
   | power         | float or [[ConsumePower][ConsumePower]] | consume or buffer power |
   | powerBuffered | float                 | amount of power buffered |

   Notes:
   * you shouldn't have ~power~ and ~powerBuffered~.

   For example with [[ConsumeItems][ConsumeItems]] and [[ConsumeLiquid][ConsumeLiquid]]:

** Attributes

   An object with an array of [[Attribute][attribute]]. Used in the ~Floor~ type to give a tile specific properties, like /hottness/ or /sporness/ for efficiency of various systems, like ThermalPumps and WaterExtractors.

   ~array~ has 4 items:

   * index ~0~ is ~heat~,
   * index ~1~ is ~spores~,
   * index ~2~ is ~water~,
   * index ~3~ is ~oil~.

    For example, this would give you ~100~ heat, ~1~ spores, ~0.5~ water and ~0.1~ oil.

    #+BEGIN_SRC json
    {
        "array": [ 100, 1, 0.5, 0.1]
    }
    #+END_SRC

    You could use it inside of [[Floor][Floor]] type as such:

    #+BEGIN_SRC json
    {
        "type": "Floor",
        "name": "magma",
        "attributes": { "array": [ 0.75, 0, 0, 0 ] }
    }
    #+END_SRC

   | cost           | float    |       1 | used for calculating place times; 1 cost = 1 tick added to build time |
   | alwaysUnlocked | boolean  |   false | If true, item is always unlocked. |

   <<ItemType>> ItemType:
   * ~resource~ can go in the core;
   * ~material~ can't go in the core.

** ItemStack

   This type is used to tell blocks to calculate their output/input rates. An item stack is simply an array of objects with the following fields:

   | field  | type | default |
   |--------+------+---------|
   | amount | int  |       1 |
   | item   | [[Item][Item]] |         |

       { "amount": 90, "item": "copper" }
   ]
   #+END_SRC

** NEW Liquid

   Extends [[Content]]

   Type which defines the properties of a liquid. Like [[Item]] this will go into it's own subdirectory ~content/liquids/liquid-name.json~, and from it's stem name you can reuse it from your other mod content.

   | field         | type         | default | notes      |

   :END:

   Extends [[Content]]

   A ~Zone~ is a type that takes a map /(named the same as the json's filename)/ and puts it into campaign. /(a zone isn't a map)/

   Every ~Zone~ has a ~Generator~, which once initialized, ~MapGenerator~ will run through the map and do /initialization related stuff./ One of those notable things, is deleting all cores on in your map and placing a ~loadout~ on top of a random one of them. This allows your campaign map to have multiple core locations. /(it doesn't matter which core was previously on the map, ~loadout~ will dictate that)/

   It is entirely possible to produce a custom schematic, but take note that this schematic must contain a ~CoreBlock~ within it.
